# NLQ-Driven-Smart-Table-Selector

An AI-driven system that intelligently selects the most relevant tables from a database schema based on natural language queries (NLQs). It seamlessly integrates with an NL-to-SQL model (such as OpenAI's GPT) to generate precise SQL queries.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Extracts essential keywords from user input.
- **Table Relevance Ranking**: Implements fuzzy matching to determine the most relevant tables.
- **Dynamic Table Selection**: Filters and selects only necessary tables for the query.
- **AI-Powered SQL Query Generation**: Uses an NL-to-SQL model to construct SQL queries.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for query input and execution.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nl-to-sql-selector.git
cd nl-to-sql-selector
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3 installed, then run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📌 Usage

### Run the Application
To start the backend:
```sh
python app.py
```
To launch the UI:
```sh
streamlit run ui.py
```

### Example Query
```python
query = "Get all customer emails and names"
```
#### Output:
```json
{
  "customers": {
    "columns": ["id", "name", "email", "created_at", "total_spent"]
  }
}
```
#### Generated SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT name, email FROM customers;
```
